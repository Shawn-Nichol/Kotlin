Class References
Teh most basic refelection feature is getting the runtime reference to a kotlin class. To obtain the reference to a statically known kotlin class you can use the class literal
syntax

```
The reference is avlue of type kClass
Note Kotlin class reference is not the same as a java class reference. To obtain a java class reference use the. java property on a kClass instance.
